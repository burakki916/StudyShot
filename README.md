# A small program to help study for material  

- figure out how to make ./studyshot.sh run when you hit a hot key, then you screenshot stuff using grimshot and it also uses rofi. tbh might need to figure out how to actually take the screenshots on your own, so i suppose studyshot.sh is just a recommnedation. 

- its important how its saved because thats how the program knows how to index it

- program uses open spaced repetition, see more about them
